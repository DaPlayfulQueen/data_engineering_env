## My docker env

A little collection of docker  services to deploy env for my
data engineering related studies. Currently has 3 profiles in docker-compose: 
- jupyter: runs container for Jupyter notebook
- pagila: runs postgres DB + pgadmin for experimenting with [pagila](https://github.com/devrimgunduz/pagila) dataset 
- flight_db: runs postgres DB + pgadmin for dataset from [SQL masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/15-days-of-sql/)
